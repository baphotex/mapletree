						<p style="text-align:center; "><b> Chapter 37 to 49: End of Season 1 Thoughts </b></p>
						<p>I have much less to say about this segment of chapters than those before, which is not that surprising giving the decrease in total length of this part, and the formularity of it being about Jousting. It certainly felt like a fitting end to the first season, and where a lot of ideas that I'd been discussing converged. Some highlights, and some not so highlights. However, overall, I am extremely pleased with the cementing of Zachary and Bianca's love for one another and the scenes of physical intimacy these chapters ended with.</p>
						<p>I think the jousting tournament format was an interesting device to bring all sorts of characters together, and have a climactic confrontation between Jacob and Zachary. However, in practice I felt it a little confusing at times. The artwork tried its best, but I found the actual jousting difficult to follow. I also thought that of all the ways they could have introduced this conflict, the tournament format made me somewhat disinterested. The number of possible options it could have taken seemed small, but I suppose it was still lovely to see what we got. </p>
						<p>Particularly, I thought the progress Zachary made at recognizing, reconciling, and acting on his feelings for Bianca was beautifully well done. I'm extremely glad that compared to other OI, the time spent with him dawdling unable to understand his attraction died pretty early on. Likewise, the art, the framing, and the actual internal monologue of him coming to this state was beautifully well done. He's really one of the best done MLs I think I've seen.</p>
						<p> The romance between Gaspar and the maid was one of my favorite parts as well. It's adorable, and the chemistry the two have is great. Gaspar himself was a really hot and interesting character in this passage - I loved how vicious he looked while jousting. Likewise, I'm consistently happy with the bond between Bianca and her maid. I hope that the relationship with Gaspar and the maid continues to be explicit and turns into something interesting in the second season.</p>
						<p> I don't entirely buy Jacob's motivations, or his supposed love for Bianca. It seems necessary for the story to move forward in its format, but it's hard for me to reconcile it being any other than posessiveness or his objectified view of Bianca than anything true. His brief descents into madness and insanity are somewhat interesting, and I'm curious to see where they'll drive him in the future with regard to Bianca. However, I don't feel like I've actually seen enough of his side of things to see him much more than a complete one sided villain. I was glad to see him get trounced by Zach, and I'm sure I will continue to in the future. </p>
						<p> All the scenes with Zachary and Bianca between him winning the tournament and the end were AMAZING. After a fairly long break of them actually doing anything, seeing them finally kiss in such a public way, express their love for another, it brought me a lot of joy. The scenes with them spending the night together were also STEAMY. I had been wanting the pair to be more intimate for some time, and finally getting it in this way was all I could have asked for. I am extremely glad that it finally happened and I hope that it only means more for the future. They're an incredible ML and FL pairing - I adore them both. </p>
						<p> Given the setup in Chapter 49, I'm really hoping to see the fruit of an explicit love between the two. Children, steamy makeout scenes, more time in bed - I will take absoltuely anything. They have wonderful chemistry with one another and it's genuinely hard to put down because of it. I'm also excited to see howt he two potentially scheme and work in tandem against their mutual foes. Given some of the chatter I've seen, I doubt I'll be dissapointed. </p>
						<p> Right at the end having the trio of hot, but awful villains ploy to take down Arno with seduction felt somewhat corny to me. Fitting for an OI, and fitting for the story, but it just doesn't seem all that interesting for me to see Fernand try and seduce Bianca for the master plan of Jacob and Hughes. I'm curious to see where the story goes in that regard, but given how solidified the feelings Zachary and Bianca have for eachother, it's difficult for me to imagine it ending up as anything more than either comedic fodder or backstory prompting. I'm not overly convinced that Fernand is all that interesitng of a villain or character, but I might be surprised. </p>
						<p> This was a fitting end to the first season, and I'll be starting the next immediately. I'm extremely pleased with this manhwa, and I hope that all the things I love about are even more prominent in the coming chapters. </p>

						<p style="text-align:center; "> <b> Chapter 21 through 36: Some Thoughts</b> </p>
					
						<p> This was quite a long stretch of chapters, but it all felt like it was also part of a secondary introduction into the future drama of the world. The introduction of the Crown family, Prince Jacob, Viscount Hughes, Bianca's scumbag family, and the other noble ladies all felt like an added breath of conflict into what had previously been pretty tame. However, despite the numerous antagonists introduced, it didn't particularly feel like the story made an overwhelming amount of progress in any particular direction. </p>
						<p>I was quite let down with how slow burn the romance between Zach and Bianca has been, especially with regard to physical intimacy. Although, it's clear to me that both have made significant progress in actually loving one another. The miscommunication and internal conflicts between them and in them is a common item in OI, and I suppose I can't be too bothered with it, but I would wish to see actual kisses and more. However, I will wait. </p>
						<p>The introduction of the Crown Family - the King, the two princes, and their backstory - was much needed and gave me a great deal of interest in the progression of the story. The dueling factions of Prince Gautler and Prince Jacob is interesting. Their past seems oddly tragic and traumatic, with both mothers dead in different horrible fashions, I can't wait to see how the relations between everyone boils over.</p>
						<p> Learning that Prince Jacob was actually a traitor was quite interesting, and made it clear to me that he seems to be primary antagonist number one rather than some sort of 2nd ML (not as if I had a place for one in my heart). Despite being arguably hotter than Zachary, and having quite the tantalizing personality, I can't find myself holding much but distate for him. The scenes he was in where he made moves on Bianca made him feel like a premier creep rather than a premier prince. My assumption is that we're heading towards a story with him in which he ends up kidnapping Bianca? I'm curious to see how it'll play out regardless. </p>
						<p> The scenes with Bianca's family hit incredibly hard, and showed a side of her personality that I was grateful to see. Her lingering resentment for being cast off in the most literal sense was palpable. Her anger, her sadness, her grief for a family she essentially lost all came out through her berating her father. Seeing her stand up for herself that way was empowering, and I hope to see more of it in the future. She's quickly becoming one of my favorite female leads ever. </p>
						<p>However, I cannot say the same for Bianca's family. Despite making up in some sense, I don't forgive her father whatsoever. Being unable to communicate his feelings makes him seem both childish and abusive. The brother is adorable, but lacks any other personality. I'm glad that they could all come to some sort of mutual conclusion and Bianca could reach a better relationship with them, but her father will need to a lot more to get in my good graces. </p>
						<p>Following that, I was interested in the introduction of Viscount Hughes - who sucks. Despite being another hottie of an antagonist, he seems less interesting and more plainly evil than Prince Jacob. His villainy towards Zachary has no place in my heart. I wish him and his scheming the worst. He is a bit hot though I can't deny, but I'll take my male lead any day thank you. </p>
						<p> The intimacy that grew between Zachary and Bianca during the above conflicts was quite lovely. It was great to see him become possessive and protective of her, especially when he picked her up later. Seeing her cry into Zachary also made her feelings quite obvious. The two have amazing chemistry both physically and their personalities work out well. It angers me that they're going through so much miscommunication and misunderstanding, because I cannot wait for the two to become rightfully and openly lovey dovey with another.</p>
						<p> The other noble ladies that were introducing seemed somewhat interesting. I like the possibility of the Countess becoming Bianca's friend in a way that isn't too uncommon for OI manhwa. However, I'm not really all that taken by the petty villainny of the rest. It doesn't feel like a story where their presence will ever be felt that much. But I'll make sure to keep my eye out for what the maid ends up doing. </p>
						<p> Wrapping things up by introducing the jousting tournament was a relief to me. It seems like we're finally due for some things to come to pass. I hope we see more physically intimacy between Bianca and Zachary. I hope the posessiveness and protectiveness of Bianca comes to play with so many hot antagonists around. I'm quite interested to see how the tournament itself shakes up, and I cannot wait to finish reading!</p>

						<p> P.S. Was I gaslit or did the maids name change to Yvvone sudenly?? </p>

				       		<p> This very much gave me 'we're introducing everything vibes.' It was sort of slice-of-lifey and fun, while also revealing a lot that made me feel more comfortable with the story as a whole, although a part of me was sort of sad that it didn't continue the angsty feel. However, I get the sense I'm being pulled into a lull and the seemingly dangerous characters of the Second Prince Jacob and Fernand will soon make their presence felt in the story. </p>

                        			<p> Foremost, I became much more fond of Bianca. The extra responsibility she took on, her resourcesfulness, her protection of her maid, and her interactions with Zachary slowly made me totally root for her in the story. I was almost surprised to see her treat Lucy, Vinny, and Nikola so well. It managed to be quite charming. Moreover, I think her approach to saving herself is, although common in OI, quite smart. I had a lot of fun seeing her throw herself at Zachary when she could, and I thought her ideas of making specialty candles and lace to cement herself were smart. I'm hoping this cements her as a FL with a lot of agency that resolves her own problems. </p> 

                       				<p> I absolutely adored the introduction of the side characters in these chapters. I feel like each of the knights add a great deal of flavor to Zachary's side of things. Sovur is completely hilarious and I adore him more than I can put into words. Robert is a little boring and serious, but a nice counterblanace. Gaspar adds a strong presence to a lot of the scenes, and his bduding romance with Lucy is adorable.  I'm quite interested to see where things go with them. </p>

                       				<p> Vinny quickly became a really fun character as well. With some scenes making him seem like a GILF and others just a really cool old guy. I'm glad that Bianca was able to get close to him and I hope it's a good sign for the rest of the story. Likewise, the relationship with Bianca and her maid Lucy is loveable. I'm really liking that Bianca is going out of her way to be nice to Lucy and protect her somewhat, and I hope she continues to do so in the future. Bianca is such a sweethear that she really deserves it. </p> 

                        			<p> It took a while for Zachary to regain prominence, but when he did he showed off his outstanding ML status and continued his overwhelming reign of hotness. So many of his scenes got me squirming and blushing and feel all sorts of hot. It's wild to me that in just 12 chapters SO MUCH of him was fit in. He's gorgeous, handsome, charming, and his slowly softening side to Bianca is wondrous. I was sort of hoping he'd be colder for longer, but the distance he's put between himself and Bianca seems to slowly be fading and I cannot wait for the two to become properly intimate. He's the BEST. </p> 

                       				<p> I'm really interested in the memories Bianca seemed to have of Fernand. I'm not sure what his role in the story is, but he seems extremely shady and potentially dangerous. He is kind of gorgeous, but he also seems morally terrible. I'm really curious how he contributed to Bianca's life and how he'll continue to play a role in the story. </p> 

                        			<p> Speaking of shady characters, I don't trust Prince Jacob whatsoever. I'm not sure if he's 2ML territory or just a villain, but either way he gives me really bad vibes despite him being very pretty.  Given that they're headed to the castle, I'm interested to see how his character develops and if my intuition proves correct. </p> 
    
                        			<p> As a whole, the story progressed in a fairly natural way and now I'm totally invested in how it'll grow. Any reservations I had are now gone and I'm really on board with the direction. I hope we'll see more conflict, intimacy with Zachary, and information about Bianca's past. Also, the art is maybe the best I've ever seen. Grade S+ so far. </p>

						<p style="text-align:center; "><b> Chapter 7 (and before) Thoughts </b></p>
						<p> I'm kind of conflicted on Bianca as a character. I'm glad that compared to other OI, it doesn't appear that after reincarnation/time travel she's figured everything out and is just a genius girl boss who can coast to victory with schemes or secret powers. But, despite (seemingly) having gone through a great deal of hardship, I don't like how she still carries that noble air of entitlement (although it is quite fitting). </p>
						<p> I don't condone her whipping a maid, it felt out of left field for me. And although I don't adore when OI fl's become lovey dovey and kind to staff that mistreat them, I also don't really love when they're abusive (but I guess that's kind of an issue I have with OI in general). </P>
						<p> But I also can see where she's coming from. Being wed off as a kid, going through years of neglect, hatred, isolated, and even coming back still feeling all that - it must suck. I hope that throughout the story she can grow more as a character. </p>
						<p> That said, on the other end, I do like Zachary a lot. I don't think I've seen enough of him yet. But he's certainly hot, and I enjoy the start of him seemingly softening up to Bianca. I just hope it isn't a complete immediate shift. </p>

						<p>I like cold ML's that don't show their feelings well. I also like FL's that are at genuine risk of hardship and have gone through it. The pairing seems to be one that I'd enjoy a lot. I'm hoping the best for this. </p>
