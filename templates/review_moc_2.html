						<p style="text-align:center; "> <b> Chapter 21 through 36: Some Thoughts</b> </p>
					
						<p> This was quite a long stretch of chapters, but it all felt like it was also part of a secondary introduction into the future drama of the world. The introduction of the Crown family, Prince Jacob, Viscount Hughes, Bianca's scumbag family, and the other noble ladies all felt like an added breath of conflict into what had previously been pretty tame. However, despite the numerous antagonists introduced, it didn't particularly feel like the story made an overwhelming amount of progress in any particular direction. </p>
						<p>I was quite let down with how slow burn the romance between Zach and Bianca has been, especially with regard to physical intimacy. Although, it's clear to me that both have made significant progress in actually loving one another. The miscommunication and internal conflicts between them and in them is a common item in OI, and I suppose I can't be too bothered with it, but I would wish to see actual kisses and more. However, I will wait. </p>
						<p>The introduction of the Crown Family - the King, the two princes, and their backstory - was much needed and gave me a great deal of interest in the progression of the story. The dueling factions of Prince Gautler and Prince Jacob is interesting. Their past seems oddly tragic and traumatic, with both mothers dead in different horrible fashions, I can't wait to see how the relations between everyone boils over.</p>
						<p> Learning that Prince Jacob was actually a traitor was quite interesting, and made it clear to me that he seems to be primary antagonist number one rather than some sort of 2nd ML (not as if I had a place for one in my heart). Despite being arguably hotter than Zachary, and having quite the tantalizing personality, I can't find myself holding much but distate for him. The scenes he was in where he made moves on Bianca made him feel like a premier creep rather than a premier prince. My assumption is that we're heading towards a story with him in which he ends up kidnapping Bianca? I'm curious to see how it'll play out regardless. </p>
						<p> The scenes with Bianca's family hit incredibly hard, and showed a side of her personality that I was grateful to see. Her lingering resentment for being cast off in the most literal sense was palpable. Her anger, her sadness, her grief for a family she essentially lost all came out through her berating her father. Seeing her stand up for herself that way was empowering, and I hope to see more of it in the future. She's quickly becoming one of my favorite female leads ever. </p>
						<p>However, I cannot say the same for Bianca's family. Despite making up in some sense, I don't forgive her father whatsoever. Being unable to communicate his feelings makes him seem both childish and abusive. The brother is adorable, but lacks any other personality. I'm glad that they could all come to some sort of mutual conclusion and Bianca could reach a better relationship with them, but her father will need to a lot more to get in my good graces. </p>
						<p>Following that, I was interested in the introduction of Viscount Hughes - who sucks. Despite being another hottie of an antagonist, he seems less interesting and more plainly evil than Prince Jacob. His villainy towards Zachary has no place in my heart. I wish him and his scheming the worst. He is a bit hot though I can't deny, but I'll take my male lead any day thank you. </p>
						<p> The intimacy that grew between Zachary and Bianca during the above conflicts was quite lovely. It was great to see him become possessive and protective of her, especially when he picked her up later. Seeing her cry into Zachary also made her feelings quite obvious. The two have amazing chemistry both physically and their personalities work out well. It angers me that they're going through so much miscommunication and misunderstanding, because I cannot wait for the two to become rightfully and openly lovey dovey with another.</p>
						<p> The other noble ladies that were introducing seemed somewhat interesting. I like the possibility of the Countess becoming Bianca's friend in a way that isn't too uncommon for OI manhwa. However, I'm not really all that taken by the petty villainny of the rest. It doesn't feel like a story where their presence will ever be felt that much. But I'll make sure to keep my eye out for what the maid ends up doing. </p>
						<p> Wrapping things up by introducing the jousting tournament was a relief to me. It seems like we're finally due for some things to come to pass. I hope we see more physically intimacy between Bianca and Zachary. I hope the posessiveness and protectiveness of Bianca comes to play with so many hot antagonists around. I'm quite interested to see how the tournament itself shakes up, and I cannot wait to finish reading!</p>

						<p> P.S. Was I gaslit or did the maids name change to Yvvone sudenly?? </p>

				       		<p> This very much gave me 'we're introducing everything vibes.' It was sort of slice-of-lifey and fun, while also revealing a lot that made me feel more comfortable with the story as a whole, although a part of me was sort of sad that it didn't continue the angsty feel. However, I get the sense I'm being pulled into a lull and the seemingly dangerous characters of the Second Prince Jacob and Fernand will soon make their presence felt in the story. </p>

                        			<p> Foremost, I became much more fond of Bianca. The extra responsibility she took on, her resourcesfulness, her protection of her maid, and her interactions with Zachary slowly made me totally root for her in the story. I was almost surprised to see her treat Lucy, Vinny, and Nikola so well. It managed to be quite charming. Moreover, I think her approach to saving herself is, although common in OI, quite smart. I had a lot of fun seeing her throw herself at Zachary when she could, and I thought her ideas of making specialty candles and lace to cement herself were smart. I'm hoping this cements her as a FL with a lot of agency that resolves her own problems. </p> 

                       				<p> I absolutely adored the introduction of the side characters in these chapters. I feel like each of the knights add a great deal of flavor to Zachary's side of things. Sovur is completely hilarious and I adore him more than I can put into words. Robert is a little boring and serious, but a nice counterblanace. Gaspar adds a strong presence to a lot of the scenes, and his bduding romance with Lucy is adorable.  I'm quite interested to see where things go with them. </p>

                       				<p> Vinny quickly became a really fun character as well. With some scenes making him seem like a GILF and others just a really cool old guy. I'm glad that Bianca was able to get close to him and I hope it's a good sign for the rest of the story. Likewise, the relationship with Bianca and her maid Lucy is loveable. I'm really liking that Bianca is going out of her way to be nice to Lucy and protect her somewhat, and I hope she continues to do so in the future. Bianca is such a sweethear that she really deserves it. </p> 

                        			<p> It took a while for Zachary to regain prominence, but when he did he showed off his outstanding ML status and continued his overwhelming reign of hotness. So many of his scenes got me squirming and blushing and feel all sorts of hot. It's wild to me that in just 12 chapters SO MUCH of him was fit in. He's gorgeous, handsome, charming, and his slowly softening side to Bianca is wondrous. I was sort of hoping he'd be colder for longer, but the distance he's put between himself and Bianca seems to slowly be fading and I cannot wait for the two to become properly intimate. He's the BEST. </p> 

                       				<p> I'm really interested in the memories Bianca seemed to have of Fernand. I'm not sure what his role in the story is, but he seems extremely shady and potentially dangerous. He is kind of gorgeous, but he also seems morally terrible. I'm really curious how he contributed to Bianca's life and how he'll continue to play a role in the story. </p> 

                        			<p> Speaking of shady characters, I don't trust Prince Jacob whatsoever. I'm not sure if he's 2ML territory or just a villain, but either way he gives me really bad vibes despite him being very pretty.  Given that they're headed to the castle, I'm interested to see how his character develops and if my intuition proves correct. </p> 
    
                        			<p> As a whole, the story progressed in a fairly natural way and now I'm totally invested in how it'll grow. Any reservations I had are now gone and I'm really on board with the direction. I hope we'll see more conflict, intimacy with Zachary, and information about Bianca's past. Also, the art is maybe the best I've ever seen. Grade S+ so far. </p>

						<p style="text-align:center; "><b> Chapter 7 (and before) Thoughts </b></p>
						<p> I'm kind of conflicted on Bianca as a character. I'm glad that compared to other OI, it doesn't appear that after reincarnation/time travel she's figured everything out and is just a genius girl boss who can coast to victory with schemes or secret powers. But, despite (seemingly) having gone through a great deal of hardship, I don't like how she still carries that noble air of entitlement (although it is quite fitting). </p>
						<p> I don't condone her whipping a maid, it felt out of left field for me. And although I don't adore when OI fl's become lovey dovey and kind to staff that mistreat them, I also don't really love when they're abusive (but I guess that's kind of an issue I have with OI in general). </P>
						<p> But I also can see where she's coming from. Being wed off as a kid, going through years of neglect, hatred, isolated, and even coming back still feeling all that - it must suck. I hope that throughout the story she can grow more as a character. </p>
						<p> That said, on the other end, I do like Zachary a lot. I don't think I've seen enough of him yet. But he's certainly hot, and I enjoy the start of him seemingly softening up to Bianca. I just hope it isn't a complete immediate shift. </p>
