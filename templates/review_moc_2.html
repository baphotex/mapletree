				        <p> This very much gave me 'we're introducing everything vibes.' It was sort of slice-of-lifey and fun, while also revealing a lot that made me feel more comfortable with the story as a whole, although a part of me was sort of sad that it didn't continue the angsty feel. However, I get the sense I'm being pulled into a lull and the seemingly dangerous characters of the Second Prince Jacob and Fernand will soon make their presence felt in the story. </p>

                        <p> Foremost, I became much more fond of Bianca. The extra responsibility she took on, her resourcesfulness, her protection of her maid, and her interactions with Zachary slowly made me totally root for her in the story. I was almost surprised to see her treat Lucy, Vinny, and Nikola so well. It managed to be quite charming. Moreover, I think her approach to saving herself is, although common in OI, quite smart. I had a lot of fun seeing her throw herself at Zachary when she could, and I thought her ideas of making specialty candles and lace to cement herself were smart. I'm hoping this cements her as a FL with a lot of agency that resolves her own problems. </p> 

                        <p> I absolutely adored the introduction of the side characters in these chapters. I feel like each of the knights add a great deal of flavor to Zachary's side of things. Sovur is completely hilarious and I adore him more than I can put into words. Robert is a little boring and serious, but a nice counterblanace. Gaspar adds a strong presence to a lot of the scenes, and his bduding romance with Lucy is adorable.  I'm quite interested to see where things go with them. </p>

                        <p> Vinny quickly became a really fun character as well. With some scenes making him seem like a GILF and others just a really cool old guy. I'm glad that Bianca was able to get close to him and I hope it's a good sign for the rest of the story. Likewise, the relationship with Bianca and her maid Lucy is loveable. I'm really liking that Bianca is going out of her way to be nice to Lucy and protect her somewhat, and I hope she continues to do so in the future. Bianca is such a sweethear that she really deserves it. </p> 

                        <p> It took a while for Zachary to regain prominence, but when he did he showed off his outstanding ML status and continued his overwhelming reign of hotness. So many of his scenes got me squirming and blushing and feel all sorts of hot. It's wild to me that in just 12 chapters SO MUCH of him was fit in. He's gorgeous, handsome, charming, and his slowly softening side to Bianca is wondrous. I was sort of hoping he'd be colder for longer, but the distance he's put between himself and Bianca seems to slowly be fading and I cannot wait for the two to become properly intimate. He's the BEST. </p> 

                        <p> I'm really interested in the memories Bianca seemed to have of Fernand. I'm not sure what his role in the story is, but he seems extremely shady and potentially dangerous. He is kind of gorgeous, but he also seems morally terrible. I'm really curious how he contributed to Bianca's life and how he'll continue to play a role in the story. </p> 

                        <p> Speaking of shady characters, I don't trust Prince Jacob whatsoever. I'm not sure if he's 2ML territory or just a villain, but either way he gives me really bad vibes despite him being very pretty.  Given that they're headed to the castle, I'm interested to see how his character develops and if my intuition proves correct. </p> 
    
                        <p> As a whole, the story progressed in a fairly natural way and now I'm totally invested in how it'll grow. Any reservations I had are now gone and I'm really on board with the direction. I hope we'll see more conflict, intimacy with Zachary, and information about Bianca's past. Also, the art is maybe the best I've ever seen. Grade S+ so far. </p>

						<p style="text-align:center; "><b> Chapter 7 (and before) Thoughts </b></p>
						<p> I'm kind of conflicted on Bianca as a character. I'm glad that compared to other OI, it doesn't appear that after reincarnation/time travel she's figured everything out and is just a genius girl boss who can coast to victory with schemes or secret powers. But, despite (seemingly) having gone through a great deal of hardship, I don't like how she still carries that noble air of entitlement (although it is quite fitting). </p>
						<p> I don't condone her whipping a maid, it felt out of left field for me. And although I don't adore when OI fl's become lovey dovey and kind to staff that mistreat them, I also don't really love when they're abusive (but I guess that's kind of an issue I have with OI in general). </P>
						<p> But I also can see where she's coming from. Being wed off as a kid, going through years of neglect, hatred, isolated, and even coming back still feeling all that - it must suck. I hope that throughout the story she can grow more as a character. </p>
						<p> That said, on the other end, I do like Zachary a lot. I don't think I've seen enough of him yet. But he's certainly hot, and I enjoy the start of him seemingly softening up to Bianca. I just hope it isn't a complete immediate shift. </p>
						<h4>She's kind of awesome tho </h4>

						<p>I like cold ML's that don't show their feelings well. I also like FL's that are at genuine risk of hardship and have gone through it. The pairing seems to be one that I'd enjoy a lot. I'm hoping the best for this. </p>
